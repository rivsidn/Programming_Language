变量展开分两种方式：

* 直接展开
* 延迟展开
  * 直接上下文中被引用时展开
  * 第二阶段需要的时候展开



## 变量引用

```
# 变量引用为直接展开
immediate
```



## 赋值操作

```
immediate = deferred
immediate ?= deferred
immediate := immediate
immediate ::= immediate
immediate += deferred or immediate
immediate != immediate

define immediate
  deferred
endef

define immediate =
  deferred
endef

define immediate ?=
  deferred
endef

define immediate :=
  immediate
endef

define immediate ::=
  immediate
endef

define immediate +=
  deferred or immediate
endef

define immediate !=
  immediate
endef

```



## 规则定义

```
immediate : immediate ; deferred
        deferred
```



## 条件语句

```
# 直接展开
ifeq (immediate, immediate)
endif

# 直接展开
ifdef immediate
endif
```



## 指令

```
